# Andrift

üìö **Project Description**

Welcome to Andrift, a powerful encryption and hashing tool developed with Go. Andrift provides functionalities for AES and RSA file encryption and decryption, as well as the calculation of hash values using SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms. The project is structured with two main folders: `/cmd` for the main application and `/pkg` for additional modules.

üîí **Encryption and Decryption**

Andrift allows you to easily encrypt and decrypt files using both AES and RSA algorithms. You can protect your sensitive data by encrypting files with a secure passphrase, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content. The decryption process is just as straightforward, providing a seamless experience to retrieve your original files.

üîê **Hash Calculation**

With Andrift, you can quickly calculate the hash value of a string or the checksum of a file. Whether you need to verify the integrity of a downloaded file or ensure the authenticity of a message, the SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms are at your disposal. Andrift generates the hash or checksum in a reliable and efficient manner, giving you peace of mind.

üìÇ **Project Structure**

The Andrift project follows a well-organized structure. The `/cmd` folder contains the main application, which serves as the entry point and orchestrates the different functionalities. On the other hand, the `/pkg` folder houses additional modules that provide extended capabilities and enhance the overall functionality of the project.

üöÄ **Installation Process**

To install Andrift, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
2. Clone the Andrift repository: `git clone https://github.com/ivanneedvodka/ANM_Lab1`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ANM_Lab1/andrift`.
4. Build the application: `go build`.
5. Run Andrift: `./andrift`.

üéâ **Conclusion**

Andrift is a versatile encryption and hashing tool built with Go. It offers secure file encryption and decryption using AES and RSA algorithms, as well as the ability to calculate hash values and checksums using SHA-1 and SHA-256. The project is neatly structured with separate folders for the main application and additional modules, ensuring a clean and manageable codebase.

üîÆ **Future Improvements**

In the future, the Andrift project could be expanded to include additional encryption algorithms like Twofish or Serpent, providing users with even more options to protect their files. Furthermore, integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) could enhance the user experience and make Andrift more accessible to a wider audience.
